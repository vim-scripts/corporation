A dark grey, yellow, blue and a little orange scheme that is easy on the eyes and quite readable imho.

Based on julievonderropp's corporation available on kuler.adobe.com.

I have a very strong feeling it reminds of the colours of some logo, but I can't remember which. I have the impression it had the head of an eagle in it but I'm not sure. If anybody knows what I'm thinking about, pleaeaease drop me a line!
